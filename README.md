# probable-node-swiftui

hummm thinking this should be a portfolio app.

Core functionality: 

- About secton
- Project gallery
- contact page
- blog posting?  
- live chat!  
- location (for fun use case)
- AR (like see if I fit in your office) this would be a wishlist iteam
- share the app with a QR code
- send people my 'card' as an apple wallet

Structure

- lets have firebase connected to the flutter web app side for content creation from anywhere on any device really
- all API requests go through the node server API
- swiftui app would be the forward facing side to view the content
